Telnet & SSH Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project explains how to set up Telnet and SSH remote access on a Cisco router in Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes basic device setup, creating a user for authentication, enabling remote login, and testing connectivity from a PC. The project helps in understanding how network engineers manage and access devices remotely, and why SSH is a more secure method compared to Telnet.
